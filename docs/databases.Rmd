# Fetching gene tracks as PyRanges

PyRanges can fetch data from UCSC, GENCODE and Ensembl through the pyranges_db add-on package.
It can be installed with `pip install pyranges_db`.

Each database contains at least two methods, namely genes and genomes. UCSC and
Ensembl also has the method chromosome_sizes.

The genes-methods all take a boolean flag `head`. If true, it only fetches a few hundred rows of data.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges_db as pr_db

genomes = pr_db.ucsc.genomes()

print(genomes.head())

chr_sizes = pr_db.ucsc.chromosome_sizes("hg38")

print(chr_sizes)

genes = pr_db.ucsc.genes("hg38", head=True)

print(genes)
```

# Uncomment: The GWAS catalogue data can also be downloaded with db.gwas_catalogue.gwas_catalogue()
