# Methods for manipulating single PyRanges

There are several methods for manipulating the contents of a PyRanges.

`cluster` is a mathematical set operation which creates a union of all the intervals in the ranges:

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
f1 = pr.data.f1()
print(f1.cluster())
```

`tssify` finds the starts of the regions (taking direction of transcription into
account). It is named -ify to make clear that it is not finding the actual tsses
(which requires metadata that signifies which intervals represent transcripts).

```{python tidy=FALSE}
f1.tssify()
print(f1.tssify(slack=5))
```

`tesify` finds the ends of the regions (taking direction of transcription into account).

```{python tidy=FALSE}
f1.tesify()
print(f1.tesify(slack=5))
```

`slack` extends the starts and ends of your interval.


```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(f1.slack(5))
```
