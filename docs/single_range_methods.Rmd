# Methods for manipulating single PyRanges

There are several methods for manipulating the contents of a PyRanges.

`merge` creates a union of all the intervals in the ranges:

The merge-method also takes the flag count to let you know the number of intervals that were merged.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
f1 = pr.data.f1()
print(f1.merge(count=True))
```

Cluster finds which intervals overlap, but gives each interval a cluster ID instead of merging them:

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
f1 = pr.data.f1()
print(f1.cluster())
print(f1.cluster(strand=True))
print(f1.cluster(slack=2, strand=True))
```

Both cluster and merge take the argument slack, so that you can merge features
which are not directly overlapping. If you set slack to -1 you avoid merging bookended features.

To cluster or merge only those rows which have the same values for a certain column, you can use the argument by to cluster and merge.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
gr = pr.data.ensembl_gtf()
print(gr)
print(gr.cluster(by="gene_id"))
```


`five_end` finds the starts of the regions (taking direction of transcription
into account).

```{python tidy=FALSE}
f1.five_end()
print(f1.five_end(slack=5))
```

`three_end` finds the ends of the regions (taking direction of transcription into account).

```{python tidy=FALSE}
f1.three_end()
print(f1.three_end(slack=5))
```

`slack` extends the starts and ends of your interval.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(f1.slack(5))
print(f1.slack({"5": 2, "3": -1}))
```

`window` splits your data into windows:

```{python tidy=FALSE}
exons = pr.data.exons()
print(exons)
print(exons.window(5))
```

If you want to all windows to start at a multiple of window_size, use the tile function:

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(exons.tile(5))
```
